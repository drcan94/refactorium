## UI/UX Principles
- Side-by-side diff: left why-its-bad, right how-to-improve.
- Short notes: impact on readability, maintainability, and defects.
- Mini test hints: 23 bullets to validate the refactor.
- Paste-your-code area: run simple analysis; show hints.

## Screens (MVP)
- Home: smell list with search/tags.
- Detail: side-by-side code, explanations, test hints, paste area.

## Dev-friendly UX
- Keyboard shortcuts: j/k navigate, c toggle diff mode.
- Copy buttons; light/dark theme.
