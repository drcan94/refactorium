### Next.js + Mantine
- The project uses Next.js (App Router) with Mantine as the component library to deliver accessible, responsive UI quickly. See Architecture for structure and API routes.
 
### Development Logs
- Maintain a `/development-steps/` folder at the repo root. Each step is a Markdown file with a number, date, and brief summary of what changed. Link the folder from the About page for transparency.
