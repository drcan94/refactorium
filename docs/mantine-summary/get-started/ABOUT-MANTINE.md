### Previous versions documentation

- v1–v7 documentation is available (e.g., `v7.mantine.dev`) for legacy projects; not required for our current v8 usage.

### Extra: Mantine logo package (optional)

- If we need Mantine branding in internal docs or demo pages: `@mantinex/mantine-logo` provides a `MantineLogo` component (depends on `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/hooks`). Not needed for our app runtime.
