## Vision
Empower developers with why-first, example-driven learning of code quality. Build a community-curated library of smells and refactor patterns that is easy to consume, remix, and extend.

### Principles
- Open source & build-in-public.
- Simplicity: zero-friction setup and contribution.
- Explainability: each example includes smell signals  impact  better approach.
- Accessibility: keyboard-first, light/dark themes, copy-friendly snippets.
- Pragmatism: Next.js + Mantine for fast iteration, strong DX, and accessible defaults.

### In the age of AI
- Human judgment remains critical: AI can produce “plausible” code that hides maintainability risks. We focus on making those risks visible and explainable.
- Collective intelligence: We capture team knowledge as reusable refactor patterns that humans and AI can apply consistently.
- Safety rails over gatekeeping: We encourage experimentation with AI while providing fast feedback loops to avoid long-term quality debt.
- Open standards: Smell definitions are portable and mappable to linters, static analyzers, and CI bots.
- Augmented learning: Pages like `/about` and the home hero surface AI-era rationale to align expectations.
